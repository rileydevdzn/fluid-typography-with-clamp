## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Responsive design
- Realistic workflow, building from professional Figma design files (design-to-code) 

### What I learned

This project was a great exercise in design-to-code. There were a lot of little details in the desktop vs. mobile designs, and this project gave me a lot of ideas for things to explore further, including improving my skills with CSS functions and fluid typography, to find solutions that are more effective than writing media queries for every screen size. I also experimented with em units to get a feel for how they scale within the cascade.  

### Continued development

Using relative em units was useful in this simple project, though I could see how they could potentially get out of control on a complex build. I'm going to dive deeper into fluid typography on a future project using viewport units, and how they could be used with other responsive techniques, like CSS functions (calc, clamp, etc.). 

### Useful resources

 - [CSS Tricks: Fluid typography](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/) - Introduction to fluid typography using CSS calc function. When I was researching typography methods, this inspired me to look into viewport units and fluid typography in the first place.
 - [CSS Tricks: Simplified fluid typography](https://css-tricks.com/simplified-fluid-typography/) - Fluid typography incorporating CSS functions and variables. I've been using CSS variables and functions, pretty excited to combine all three in an upcoming project!
